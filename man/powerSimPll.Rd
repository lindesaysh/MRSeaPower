\title{Function to run a power analysis for a model of type 'gamMRSea'}
\usage{
powerSimPll(newdat, model, empdistribution, nsim, powercoefid,
  predictionGrid = NULL, g2k = NULL, splineParams = NULL, n.boot = 500,
  nCores = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{newdat}{matrix of values whose rows are observations and columns are simulated sets of response data}

\item{model}{model object of class `gamMRSea`.  This is the model used to generate the data, updated for the inclusion of an event term.}

\item{empdistribution}{Empirical distribution for the runs test}

\item{nsim}{number of simulations to compute}

\item{powercoefid}{the ID of the coefficient in \code{model} that represents the event term}

\item{predictionGrid}{dataframe containing a coordinate grid with covariates.  This grid is used in the assessment of before and after change differences.}

\item{g2k}{object required for \code{MRSea} model with spline terms}

\item{splineParams}{object required for \code{MRSea} model with spline terms}

\item{n.boot}{Number of bootstraps to use to get percentile based confidence intervals for predictions.}

\item{nCores}{How many cores to use for parallel processing.  If one, then parallel computing is not used and a progress bar is printed. If parallel, estimated time till finish along with a progress bar is provided.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{gamMRSea.power}.

\item{rawrob}{Vector of zeros and ones indicating whether raw or robust s.e. have been used.}
\item{imppvals}{p-values for the event change term for each simulated run}
\item{betacis}{Confidence intervals for the event term coefficient (only if site-wide change)}
\item{powsimfits}{Fitted values each model}
\item{bootdifferences}{data frame of bootstrapped differences (before and after event). Number of rows is the number of rows in the prediction grid divided by 2}
\item{bootpreds}{data frame of bootstrapped predictions.}
\item{Abundance}{Table of sitewide abundance (with upper and lower 95\% CI)}
\item{link}{List of the link function (link) and inverse link function (linkinv)}
