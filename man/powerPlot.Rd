\title{Function to show how the power to detect change varies with the error rate.}
\usage{
powerPlot(power.object)
}
\arguments{
\item{power.object}{An object of class gamMRSea.power}
}
\value{
Plot showing how the power to detect change varies with increasing error rate. The first grey dashed line is at 1% and the second at 5%, traditionally values used as p-value cutoffs. The blue dashed lines indicate the error rate required to get a power of 80%. This value is given in the title.
