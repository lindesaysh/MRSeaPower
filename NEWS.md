# MRSeaPower 1.2

## Notes

* General:

* Vignettes:

  - New vignette for a power analysis on a simple spatial model with redistribution impact.

* Other: 

  - Updated publication page with 2017 report and weblink. 

  
## Bug Fixes

* General Code

  - fixed issue with "not finding aR" when running the `powerSimPll` function for a spatial `MRSea` model
  - fixed issue with finding Tweedie family in the parallel part of the `powerSimPll` function.
  - fixed summary and print functions for objects of class `gamMRSea.power`.  Methods class added to namespace export. 

* Documentation

# MRSeaPower 1.0.99-beta (devo)

## Notes

* General:

  - Website initiated and under development. Added README for website homepage. 
  - removed functions that were duplicated in `MRSea` (`generateNoise`, `rpois.od`).  `MRSea` functions are more up to date so this package is specified as a requirement to run `MRSeaPower`. 
  - update to `genChangeData` function.  Allows users to specify the fitted values from the model instead of requiring the model object. 

* Vignettes:

  - `UsingMRSeaPower` all code checked. Updates to change to `ggplot` in places. 
  - New vignette for imposing changes: `genchangeData`
  - New vignette for an introduction to the package: `IntroductiontoMRSeaPower`.  This vignette gives an overview of the power analysis process and possible outputs without the details of coding.
  - New vignette for a power analysis on a simple spatial model with redistribution impact.

## Bug Fixes

* General Code

  - fixed error with `powerPlot` function
  - fixed issue with "not finding aR" when running the `powerSimPll` function for a spatial `MRSea` model
  - fixed issue with finding Tweedie family in the parallel part of the `powerSimPll` function.
  - fixed summary and print functions for objects of class `gamMRSea.power`.  Methods class added to namespace export. 

* Documentation

  - fixed documentation error associated with use of percent sign in `genChangeData`, `plot.coverage`, `plot.preds`, `plot.sigdiff`,  `powerSimParallel`
